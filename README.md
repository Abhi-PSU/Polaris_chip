When doing the tutorial, what did you get stuck on?
 - I got stuck on the pushing to the new website, I didnt understand that I could just cmd + S to refresh the website to see changes and updates, so I kepts closing and reopening it over and over again.

In reading through the deck / tutorials / googling / "lit cheat sheet", what's not making sense?
 - Everything made sense, it just took me a while and I had to rely on claude and yt tutorials to walk me through things, mostly because I didn't understand the why behind certain steps or why we did things a specific way.

Same, but what DOES make sense? Is this a superior approach to coding in the 'global scope' ala code pen, or does this scoping make it more complicated?
 - I think everything made sense after I put enough time into it. I do belive this is a better way of coding than code pen becuase it gives you a lot more control instead of putting in a beginner friendly environment. I strongly belive this is important to get used to now before going into an internship or job as it familiraizes you with the programming workspaces a lot more. I definetly wouldn't say this is easier, its a lot more complicated and time consuming but the end result is a much better quality product and is acutally usable.
